Situated at an altitude of 2100 m above sea level in the Anantnag district of Kashmir, Pahalgam is well known for its scenic beauty serving as a site where many films were shot. The Himalayan mountain ranges covered with snow, lush pine forests, and sprawling green meadows make this place a must-visit place in Kashmir. Also called the Valley of Shepherds, Pahalgam is located on the banks of the Lidder River and is famous for adventure activities like hiking, trekking, golfing, and angling. Pahalgam serves as the base for one of the most important pilgrimages in India called the Amarnath Yatra where pilgrims trek to the Amarnath caves. In addition, the long stretches of rivers in Pahalgam are the perfect site for people who enjoy trout fishing and angling as plenty of trouts are available during the peak season.
